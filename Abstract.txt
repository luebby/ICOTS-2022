Purpose: 
Without random sampling and/ or random allocation, even descriptive statistics like simple means or proportions can be quite misleading. 
Bias and confounding as well as missing data are ubiquitous in big multivariable data. 
Causal diagrams provide a way to teach and discuss the assumed data generating process.  
So it can be decided if the data at hand is appropriate to describe the phenomenon under investigation.


Design: 
Causal diagrams were added to the existing course materials to illustrate the differences between random and convenience sample as well as between observational and experimental study.
They were motivated and questioned with simple examples from the lives of students.
Student understanding in different courses was assessed with a pre-/post-survey and students were asked to evaluate the helpfulness of the diagrams for their understanding.  

Results:
With more than five different courses and 225 students there is a statistical discernible positive effect from pre- to post-knowledge. 
Also a majority of the students agreed with the statement that the causal diagrams helped in their understanding.

Implications for theory and practice:
Integration of causality might help to understand fundamental concepts of data literacy like e.g. bias.
Diagrams seems to provide an accessible way to discuss this.

Importance:
Statistics education should provide students a conceptual framework to scrutinize the data generating process in a data centric world. 
Integration of topics as causal inference even in a introductory course in statistics helps to prepare students not to mess with data.
Such critical thinking about data is necessary for making trustworthy decisions based on data.
