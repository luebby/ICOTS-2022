Purpose: 
Without random sampling and/ or random allocation even descriptive statistics like simple means or proportions can be quite misleading. 
Bias and confounding are ubiquitous in big data. Causal diagrams provide a way to teach and discuss the data generating process if the data at hand is appropriate to describe the phenomenon under investigation.  

Design: 
Causal diagrams were added to the existing course materials to illustrate the differences between random and convenience sample as well as observational and experimental study.
Student understanding in different courses was assessed with a pre-/post survey and students were asked to evaluate the helpfulness of the diagrams for their understanding.  

Results:
The proportion of correct answers increased over all courses. 
Also a majority of agreed with the statement that the causal diagrams helped in their understanding.

Implications for theory and practice:
Integration of causality might help to understand fundamental concepts of data literacy like bias.
Diagrams seems to provide an accessible way to discuss this.

Importance:
Statistics education should provide students a conceptual framework to scrutinize the data generating process in a data centric world. Such critical thinking about data is necessary for making trustworthy decisions based on data.
